# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What are the main differences between a stateful and a functional component?
    A functional component depends on a props value and a stateful component depends on a states value.
2. When does a componentWillMount function be called? What about a componentWillUpdate?
    componentWillMount is invoked immediately in the react lifecycle and componentWillUpdate is invoked when a value is needed to be changed.
3. Define stateful logic.
    Stateful logic is any code that uses state, wherever a custom hook is used that state is recreated.
4. What are the three step of creating a successful test? What is done in each phase?
    Arrange, act, and assert. Arrange is where we insert our render, act is where we find what we want to test, and assert is where we expect.
